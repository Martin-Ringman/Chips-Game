# Chips-Game

Finally! A program version of everyone's favorite childhood game: "Chips".

This is a simple Python program that lets a human play against the computer in the game of chips.

## Description

- The game starts with two piles of chips.
- The player chooses how many chips to start with in each pile.
- On each turn, the human and the computer take turns removing chips from one pile.
- The player who takes the last chip loses.

The program uses a few small functions to handle game setup, input, display, and updates. The computer move is a simple mirror of the human's last move on the opposite pile.

## How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed, then run:

```bash
python game_of_chips.py
